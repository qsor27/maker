# Contributing

While I'm happy to accept code contributions I must retain the ability
to do with the Maker project what I like, which primarily means
keeping the rights to release a closed source version in the
future. This requires that all contributions grant me the rights to
relicense and reuse the contribution as I see fit, even under a
non-open closed source license.

Before contributing code please read the contributor agreement in
CLA-individual.md then make a commit agreeing to the agreement as part
of your first pull request.

## Agreeing to the Contributor Agreement

When submitting a pull request for the first time, you will need to
agree to the contributor license agreement (for individuals or
entities). To do this, in the pull request please create a file with a
name like /contributors/{yourname}.md, and in the content of that file
indicate your agreement. An example of what that file should contain
can be seen in /contributors/_template.md agreement file.
